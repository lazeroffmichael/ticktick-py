        !!! example
            Since each TickTick object like tasks, lists, and tags are just dictionaries of fields,
            we can find an object by
            comparing the fields.

            For example: Lets say that we wanted to find and delete an existing task object from our local state
            with the name 'Get Groceries'. To do this, we can specify the field(s) that we want to compare for in
            the task objects -> in this case the `title` 'Get Groceries'.

            The call to the function would look like this:

            ```python
            # Assumes that `client` is the name referencing the TickTickClient instance.

            deleted_task = client.delete_from_local_state(title='Get Groceries')
            ```
            `deleted_task` would now hold the object that was deleted from the [`state`](api.md#state)
            dictionary if it was found.

            Furthermore if we know the type of object we are looking for, we can make the search more efficient by
            specifying the key its located under in the [`state`](api.md#state) dictionary.

            ```python
            # Assumes that `client` is the name referencing the TickTickClient instance.

            deleted_task = client.delete_from_local_state(title='Get Groceries', search='tasks')
            ```

            The search will now only look through `tasks` in `state`.


        Arguments:

            **kwargs: Matching fields in the object to look for.
